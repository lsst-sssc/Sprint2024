							<h3> Introduction to the LSST Solar System Readiness Sprint </h3>
							
 							 <p> The Sprint is designed to be different than some of the other meetings you've attended. The Sprint is designed to be as interactive as we can make it in a virtual setting. The idea to spend some dedicated time to think about Rubin Observatory
								 and LSST Solar System data products and carve out some time to try and kickstart some activities that you can carry forward during the year. There will be some talks, discussion sessions, and project time.  On the second day of the workshop, 
								 atteendees will pitch projects. It's okay if you don't have a project idea, some people with pitch ideas looking for help. So there will be ways you can get involved during the Sprint. </p>
							
							
							<h3> Remote Participation and Communications </h3>
							<p> We will be streaming the talks for those who cannot attend in person. Further details will be sent via email on the meeting slack.</p>
						
							<h3> COVID-19 Protocols and Masking Policy</h3>
							<p> There is clear emperical data that mask wearing and airflow minimize the spread of COVID-19 virus in indoor gatherings and helps protect those with pre-existing conditions that may be exacerbated by a COVID infection.  
							<b> We ask that attendees use N95, KN95, KF94, or FFP2  masks (or their equivalents) in the meeting spaces</b>, except when consuming food or beverages.  The organisers will provide these masks for free for any who need them. Presenters will be allowed to remove their masks during their presentations, and members of the audience asking questions will be able to lower their masks to speak as needed. 
							We want to ensure that everyone who attends the Sprint is able to attend Asteroids, Comets, Meteors 2023 directly following the Sprint. We believe that asking participants to mask will maximize the chances that everyone will be able to safely join ACM 2023 in person. </p>
							<p> If you do test positive for COVID-19 during or shortly after the meeting, please let the organisers know so we can make attendees aware about the possible exposure. </p>
							
							<h3>  Lateral Flow Tests </h3>

							<p> We will also have a small number of lateral flow tests available to attendees. If you are in need one please reach out to the organizers </p> 
							
							<h3> Venue </h3>
							<p> The Sprint will be the two days before Asteroids, Comets, Meteors 2023 in Flagstaff, Arizona. We'll be hosted at Nothern Arizona University (NAU).  </p>
							
							<h3> Code of Conduct </h3>
							<p> All attendees have agreed to and are expected to follow the SSSC Code of Conduct at all times. A copy of the Sprint Code fo Conduct can be found <a href='https://lsst-sssc.github.io/Sprint2023/code_of_conduct.html'>here</a>. </p>  

								
							<h3> What do you mean by project? </h3>
							<p> A project can be a wide variety of things, spanng everything from exploring the simulated LSST Solar System database, writing a paper/white paper/AAS Research note draft,  brainstorming a funding proposal idea, learning a new tool, software development, drafting an observing proposal, etc. Basically 
								anything that is going to help you get ready for Day 1 of LSST. We'll have time during Day 1 to brainstorm project ideas, and on Day 2, we'll have time for everyone who wants to lead a project to pitch their project. It's totally okay if you don't have a project idea. If you don't have a project in mind that's okay too, you can join one or more of the projects that are pitched on Day 2. The goal is to get together and spend a few dedicated days making something or learning a new skill that will help get you ready for LSST data. </p>
							</p>
						
						       
						       <h3> What are Unconference Sessions? </h3>
						
							<p> These are dedicated timeslots without a set agenda; participants will decide what is to be discussed/presented on the day of. This could be a discussion, debate, demo,tutorial, etc. Topics will be pitched and then voted on. The top three or four topics will be assigned rooms. If you have a discussion topic you want to bring up at the consortium meeting, this is the best way to do it. </p>
